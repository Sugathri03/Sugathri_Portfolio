        <h3 class="section-title">👩‍💻 My Tech Journey</h3>
        <p>
            From debugging circuits in my undergrad to debugging code in production, my path into tech has been anything but boring.
            I started as an Electronics and Communication Engineer at JNTU Hyderabad and quickly realized my passion leaned more towards secure systems than signal processing.
            After working at Virtusa as a .NET developer, I found myself fascinated by not just writing code but protecting it. That curiosity led me to pursue a Master’s in Computer and Information Systems Security at CSUDH, where I’m diving deep into everything from Zero Trust Architecture to CloudDevSecOps.

            <em>Motto:</em> If it can be hacked, I want to know how… and more importantly, how to stop it.

        <h3 class="section-title">🎨💃✈️ Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me:</p>
        <ul class="fun-list">
          <li>🧪 Turning my kitchen into a test lab.</li>
          <li>💃 If dancing was a coding language, I’d be fluent in all frameworks.</li>
          <li>🎨 I switch from keyboard to paintbrush — acrylics are my therapy, and blank canvases don’t throw exceptions.</li>
          <li>🗺️ I love exploring new places — both on maps and GitHub repos and I debug my mind by changing time zones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section-title">🌍 A Global Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Born in India, engineered in Hyderabad, and now securing apps in sunny California, my journey has been one big cross-continental code deployment.
            From chai-fueled study sessions to coffee-powered night calls, I’ve learned to adapt across time zones, cultures, and caffeine types. Whether it’s a team sync at 8 AM PST or 9:30 PM IST, you’ll get the same energy (just in different mugs).
            Working globally taught me that good code speaks many languages — and great security comes from seeing the world through more than one firewall.
