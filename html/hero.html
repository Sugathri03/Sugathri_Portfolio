          <h3 class="section-title">👩‍💻 My Tech Journey</h3>
          <p>
            From debugging circuits in my undergrad to debugging code in production, my path into tech has been anything but boring.
            I started as an Electronics and Communication Engineer at JNTU Hyderabad and quickly realized my passion leaned more towards secure systems than signal processing.
            After working at Virtusa as a .NET developer, I found myself fascinated by not just writing code but protecting it.
            That curiosity led me to pursue a Master’s in Computer and Information Systems Security at CSUDH, where I’m diving deep into everything from Zero Trust Architecture to CloudDevSecOps.

            <em>Motto:</em> If it can be hacked, I want to know how… and more importantly, how to stop it.

          <h3 class="section-title">🌍 A Global Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            Born in India, engineered in Hyderabad, and now securing apps in sunny California, my journey has been one big cross-continental code deployment.
            Working globally taught me that great security comes from seeing the world through more than one firewall.
